# Aether Test Project

django app to compute energy rates from utilities in the US based on inputs from users.

## Getting Started

First, clone the project:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/renand05/aether-energy
$ cd <my-project-name>
```

Then, using vscode open the folder containg the app using remote developer containers. Remote developer containers will intall all the packages needed to run the django app. Once your initial setup is done, open a terminal inside vscode and run:

```bash
$ poetry run python3 manage.py runserver
```

Now your app is up and running and you can check the demo website in localhost on port 8000.
